# LispTasks

Lisp solutions to different small tasks. Mostly done on Clojure but some solutions are written on Common Lisp. No taks description, no comments (actually, there are some), nothing at all. If, for some reason, you ended up here - don't blame me for that.

And yeah, you are free to do whatever you want with them.
